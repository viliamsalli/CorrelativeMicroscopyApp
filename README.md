# Correlative Microscopy App
![splash](splash.png)

## Key features
-Image overlay<br>
-Intuitive manual image alignment<br>
-Image visualization<br>
-Image enhancement<br>
-Analysis<br>

We are developing a software for overlaying and analyzing images, creating visualizations. The software is capable of processing generic image formats. It is specifically developed for correlative microscopy but can be used for many applications. Image alignment can be done easily and accurately by hand or by automatic tools, and further enhanced by various options. The software provides the user with creative ways of interacting with the data, and specific functionalities can be utilized to extract hidden information from the existing data.

The goal for the program is to be as accessible and versatile as possible, and not constrained by the type of the images. Industry standard software can often have a steep learning curve and high maintenance costs, and we aim to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use option that competes with existing programs. The project is work-in-progress, but it is already a useful tool in laboratory settings.

## Installing

MATLAB Runtime 2022b or 2023a is required, which can be installed [here](https://se.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). This needed to be done only once, and later program releases utilize the same Runtime. 
Install the latest version from the releases tab, and run the software.
